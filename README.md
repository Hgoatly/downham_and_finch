## Design:

### Imagery:

- On the landing page, the Hero image is one of lots of small birds. They represent 'Finch' in the name of the company, as a finch is a small bird that is very 
similar to those in the image. It was downloaded from [unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com/)

![Downham and Finch Hero Image](media/hero_image.jpg)

- The origin of all other images is detailed in the [Credits](#Credits) section,

### Colours Used:

- Black (#000) was chosen as the background colour for the navbar, footer, hero image logo and call to action buttons because it contrasts well with the 
hero image. 

- Gold (#D4AF37) was used for all text and icons that are on the black background as it goes well with the hero image, as well as making a good contrast 
with the black background.

- White (#fff) was used as the backgorund, and black (#000) was used for the text on all pages other than the landing page so that the background and text do 
not detract from the products displayed.

- Turquoise (#17a2b8) was chosen as the colour for the basket when there are items in it, as it makes a good contrast with the other colours on the site.


### Typography:

- 'Parisienne' was chosen for all logo elements and page titles as it is striking, and appropriate for a logo.
- 'Open Sans' was chosen for all other text because it's clean and easy to read.

### Features:

#### Mobile Design Features:

The Downham and Finch website follows the principles of mobile-first, responsive design. With this in mind, the following features on the mobile site differ 
from those on larger screens.

- The navbar has been collapsed, and is accessed by clicking on the 'hamburger' icon in the top left hand corner of the screen. When the 'hamburger'
icon is clicked, the 'All Products', 'Face Masks', 'Pet Products' and 'bags' links are displayed, as well as a 'home' link.

- The Search box has been replaced by an icon, which displays a search box when clicked.

- The 'Search', 'About', 'My Account' and 'Basket' icons have had their padding reduced, so that they fit on one line.

- The product images on the products page are displayed one per row, in order to make best use of space, and to be visually appealing.

#### Tablet Design Features:

The tablet design has most of the same features as the mobile site, except those detailed below:

- The products are displayed two products per row, rather than 4 on the desktop site, and 1 on the mobile site.

#### Desktop Design Features:

The desktop design has some of the same features as the obile and tablet versions. The differences are detailed below:

- The fixed navbar is not collapsed, and spans the width of the page.

- Products on the products page are displayed with 4 products per row.

#### Interactive Features:

The Downham and Finch website has been built around the principles of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and all of these actions can be taken on 
the site:

- **Register**: The site visitor can add their details to open an account on the site.
- **Login**: The site visitor can login to the site if they are an existing user.
- **Contact**: Any User can contact the site owner by email.
- **Sort**: Any user can sort the products by price, name or category.
- **Search**: Any user can search the site using keywords.
- **Checkout**: Any user can make a secure purchase using Stripe.
- **Add Product**: The superuser (Admin) can add products to the database.
- **Edit Product**: The superuser (Admin) can edit products that are already in the database.
- **Delete Product**: The superuser (Admin) can delete products that are already in the database.
- **Edit Content**: The superuser (Admin) can edit the content on the 'About' page.
- **Add Blog**: The superuser (Admin) can add a post to the 'Blog page'.
- **Edit Blog**: The superuser (Admin) can edit a blog post.
- **Delete Blog**: The superuser (Admin) can delete a blog post.
- **Add Faq**: The superuser (Admin) can add a Faq.
- **Edit Faq**: The superuser (Admin) can edit a Faq.
- **Delete Faq**: The superuser (Admin) can delete a Faq.
- **Add Review**: A logged in and registered user can add a review.
- **Delete Review**: The superuser (Admin) can delete a review.
- **About**: The Superuser (Admin) can update the 'About' section. It is NOT possible to delete the 'About' section. 
There is currently no image on the 'About' page, although the Model is set up to be able to accept one. This is because
the site is a real world application, and the business owner may decide that they would like an image there in future. 
This would otherwise mean a lot of work for the developer.

#### Future Features:

In future I would like to add the following features:

- **Verified Purchases**: I would like to allow only customers who have bought an item to be able to leave a review for it. 
- **Custom Products**: I would like to be able to allow customers to be able to choose the fabric for their product from a selection on the site.
- **Wishlist**: I would like users to be able to create a wishlist.
- **Delivery Address**: I would like users to be able to specify different billing and delivery addresses.
- **Paypal**: I would like users to be able to pay for their items using Paypal.
- **Apple Pay**: I would like users to be able to pay for their items using Apple Pay.
- **Documentation**: More photos will be added to the documentaion, in order to make explanations more explicit.

## Technologies used:

### languages Used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Python

### Frameworks, Libraries and Other Sources Used:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) was used as the principal framework for the project.
- [Django Crispy Forms](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used for all forms on the site.
- [Django Allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used for user authentication on the site.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) was used to handle payments on the site.
- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to aid reponsive design.
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) S3 was used to store all static CSS and Javascript files, and images.
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is the database that was used in production.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the database used by the deployed site.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) hosts the Downham and Finch website.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was used extensively throughout the site, in order to provide functionality for Bootstrap elements, and for Stripe. 
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) was used as an IDE for this project. 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is where the Downham and Finch's repository is stored. Regular commits were made throughout, and code was pushed to GitHub from GitPod.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for icons on the site.

## Information Architechture:

### Database Choice:

- SQLight was used in development, as it comes pre-installed with Django.
- PostgreSQL was used for the deployed site, as it is offered as an optional add-on by Heroku.

### Data Modeling:

- The image below was produced using the [Draw SQL app](#https://drawsql.app/)

<img src="static/readme_images/database_diagram.jpg">

## Accessibility:

### Alt Tags:

In order to ensure that all images are accessible for those using a screen reader, I have ensured that all images used 
throughout the site include alt tags.

## Testing:

Information about tests carried out can be found in a separate [testing.md](testing.md) file.

### Known Bugs and Fixes:

- On the edit product form, as well as the add product form, it is possible to set the 'quantity in pack' field to 0 or a negative integer. 
This is not ideal, and poor UX, but will be fixed in due course when I have more time and knowledge.

- There is a small amount of overflow on the navbar dropdown menus on the right of the screen on the smallest screens.
This will be fixed when I have more time.

- All successful messages are displayed on the same toast. It seems strange to have messages about product updates
with shopping basket items below them. When I have more knowledge, I will decouple these messages, so that they 
display separately.

- When adding or editing a product, the newly selected image is not displayed on the add_product/edit_product pages.
This is poor UX, as even though it is displayed on the product-detail page after the form has been submitted, 
it leaves the user wondering whether their image has been uploaded or not. I will fix this when I have the knowledge 
to do so.

## Deployment:

### Heroku deployment with AWS:

- The Downham and Finch website was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the following steps:

1. Install gunicorn, psycopg2-binary and dj-database-url using the ```PIP Install``` command.
2. Freeze all the requirements for the project into a requirements.txt file using the ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt``` command.
3. Create a procfile, with the following inside it: ```web: gunicorn downham_and_finch.wsgi:application```.
4. Push these changes to GitHub, using ```git add .```, ```git commit -m``` and ```git push``` commands.
5. Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), and login or create an account.
6. Once logged in, click on 'resources'.
7. From the add-ons search bar, add the Heroku Postgres DB, select the free account, and then submit order form to add it to the project.
8. From the app's dashboard, click on 'settings', and then 'reveal config vars' in order to set the necessary configuration variables for the project. 
It should look like this: 

| Key                   | Value                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     | Your AWS Access Key        |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Your??AWS??Secret??Access??Key |
| DATABASE_URL          | Your Database URL          |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS       | Your Email Password        |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER       | Your Email Address         |
| SECRET_KEY            | Your Secret Key            |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY     | Your Stripe Public Key     |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY     | Your Stripe Secret Key     |
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET      | Your Stripe WH Key         |
| USE_AWS               | TRUE                       |

9. Back on the main dashboard, click on 'deploy', and then under the 'Deployment' method section, select GitHub and 'Automatic Deploys'.
10. Ensure that in settings.py, the following code is commented out:
```
Database
 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#databases
```
and the at the following code is added:
```
DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
```
11. Make migrations using the following command:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
```
and migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following command:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
```
12. Load the fixtures from the 'product_types.json' file and then from the 'products.json' file - which are contained in the 'fixtures' folder into the database. 
This is done by using the following command:
```
python3 manage.py loaddata <file name>
```
13. Create a new superuser with the following command:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
and then enter chosen email, username and password.
14. In settings.py, contain the previously entered database setting in an if statement, and add an else condition, so that different databases are 
used depending on the environment.
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
```
15. Disable 'COLLECTSTATIC' with the fillowing code: ``` heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 ``` 
so that Heroku doesn't attempt to collect the static files.
16. Add ```ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['downham-and-finch.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']``` to settings.py.
17. Add Stripe environment variables to settings.py.
18. Push to Heroku using the following command:
```git push heroku master```

### Amazon Web Services:

All Static and media files for the deployed version of the site are hosted in a Amazon Web Services(AWS) S3 bucket. 
In order to create your own bucket, please follow the instructions on the AWS website 
[Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html)

1. In the gitpod terminal, install boto3 and django-storages using the following commands:
```pip3 install boto3 ``` and ```pip3 install django-storages```
2. Freeze the new requirements into the 'requirements.txt' file using the ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt``` command
3. Add 'storages' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.
4. Add the following code to settings.py in order to link the AWS bucket to the website:
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'downham-and-finch'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
5. Create a custom_storages.py file in the root level of the project. Inside it, include the locations of the Static Storage and Media Storage.
6. Delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from the Heroku Config Variables.
7. Finally, push to GitHub, and all changes should be automatically pushed to Heroku too.

### Making a Local Clone:
In order to make a local clone of the Downham and Finch website, enter ```git clone https://github.com/Hgoatly/downham_and_finch.git``` into the
terminal. 

Alternatively, you can follow these steps, which are detailed on the official 
[GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)

Next, create an .env.py file in the root directory of the project, and add it to the .gitignore file. 
The following code needs to be added to the .env.py file:
```
import os  
os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret Key>"
os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public Key>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret Key>"

## Credits:

### Code:

- **Code Institute Boutique Ado Project**: Much of this project was copied and adapted from the Code Institute 'Boutique Ado' project. Comments stating this have been added to the top
of files that have been copied and adapted in this way, as well as to views, as it was felt that by commenting on every piece of copied code 
would mean that the comments would detract from the code. If there is additional code that has been copied from Boutique Ado and NOT acknowledged in 
the corresponding file, then it is in error, and should have been acknowledged. 
- **Footer Element**: The footer element was copied and adapted from https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/navigation/footer/.
- **Code Institute Slack Channels**: Slack was used extensively for debugging, and to bounce ideas off other students and CI staff members.

-**W3 Schools**: W3 Schools was referenced for debugging purposes.
